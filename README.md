# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-Using-EMD-SVR
This project presents an ensemble method composed
of Emprirical Mode Distribution (EMD) algorithm and Support
Vector Regression (SVR) for Bitcoin price prediction by analyzing
the time series data of Bitcoin process. Bitcoin price prediction is
one of the most challenging tasks of time series forecasting due
to the inherent non-linearity and nonstationary characteristics
of the bitcoin market and financial time series. It has recently
attracted considerable attention in the fields of economics,
cryptography and computer science due to its inherent nature
of combining encryption technology and monetary units. Here,
we attempt to predict the Bitcoin price accurately taking into
consideration various parameters that affect the Bitcoin value.
Our data set consists of various blockchain parameters relating
to the Bitcoin price and payment network over the course of five
years recorded daily. Along with this, we also used the data set of
5 other cryptocurrencies to observe the relation of Bitcoin price
to the price of these cryptocurrencies. The proposed EMD-SVR
model is evaluated with recent one month price data set.
